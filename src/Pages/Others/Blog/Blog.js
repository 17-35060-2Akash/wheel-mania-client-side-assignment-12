                            it enables you to store, handle, delete, and modify data in an organized way. As for  <strong className='text-teal-400'>NoSQL</strong>,
                            it is a non-relational database that does not use SQL. Here is a table to track the differences easily:

                            It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider. So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.
                            <u className='text-green-600'>The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data.</u> JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.
                            JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.
                        </p>

                        <p className="py-6 text-blue-600 font-semibold text-xl">How it works?</p>
                        <p className="py-6 py-6 text-lg">When a user registers to a new website, he's given a two tokens from the server side.
                            The server issues initially an <span className='text-2xl text-purple-600'> Access token</span> and a <span className='text-2xl text-purple-600'> Refresh Token</span> which are provided to the client side. Basically in the client side
                            these are saved in either the Local Storage or a bit more safer place as HTTP only cookies. When the user logs in bu using his id, the access token'
                            is checked by the server and he gets in. Moreover access tokens are temporary.
                            When it expires, the server asks for the refresh token and issue another access token.
                            This is a continious process.</p>
                        <p className="py-6 py-6 text-lg text-amber-600">But the refresh token expires a date later mostly a long duration and the user has to
                            sign in for both of these tokens. This is the simplest thought.</p>

                            in order to accommodate the singlethreaded event loop.
                            It can process upwards of 1000
                            requests per second and speed limited only to the speed of

                            clients connected simultaneously. It can handle the 10000 simultaneous clients without issue.
